Bartool is a dedicated Laravel package to help you keep track of your [Saloon](https://github.com/saloonphp/saloon) requests & responses.

Barstool will allow you to easily view, search, and filter your logs directly in your database tool of choice.

The package is designed to be as simple as possible to get up and running, with minimal configuration required.

So pull up a barstool, grab a drink, and let's get logging in the Saloon! Yeehaw!

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require craigpotter/barstool
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="barstool-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="barstool-config"
```

You should also set up Laravel Model Pruning in your scheduler. Please check the Laravel Documentation for your version to know where to put the code below. 
```php
use CraigPotter\Barstool\Models\Barstool;


Schedule::command('model:prune', [
    '--model' => [Barstool::class],
])->daily();
```

## Usage

That's all folks! 
Once installed, it will start logging your [Saloon](https://github.com/saloonphp/saloon) requests automatically.
Check the config out for more control. 

Here are some of the things you can see with Barstool:
- Request Method
- Connector Used
- Request Used
- Request URL
- Request Headers
- Request Body
- Response Status Code
- Response Headers
- Response Body
- Response Duration

The logging will even log fatal errors caused by your saloon requests so you can see what went wrong.
